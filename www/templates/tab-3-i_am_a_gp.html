		<p>I am a GP - that means I am a General practitioner or a family doctor. 
		I can look after you when you are ill. I can also help you to stay well. 
		I am close to your house or where you sleep so Iâ€™m always nearby.</p>

		<p>Ask at the reception desk to join. Everyone regardless of their
		immigration status is allowed to join a practice and have a doctor like me -
		and this is a free service.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I am very busy and you may have to wait for an appointment 
		but you can discuss this at the reception desk - and they can help work 
		out with you when you can be seen</p>

		<p>At our appointment we will usually have up to ten mins to talk about
		your health needs.</p>

		<p>I look forward to meeting and working with you.</p>
